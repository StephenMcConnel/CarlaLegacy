	/// <summary>
	/// BidirHashtable is a simple, bidirectional data structure
	/// designed around Hashtables and accessed like a more robust Hashtable.
	/// Internally it just contains two hashtables:
	/// one maps from key to value, the other maps from value to key.
	/// (Therefore, note that both types of objects must have reasonable
	/// GetHashCode() and Equals() implementations.)
	/// Lookup in either direction is quick;
	/// changes take twice as long since two Hashtables are accessed.
	/// It is not currently serializable, but aside from that,
	/// it implements the same interfaces as a Hashtable.
	/// Forward lookup is just through the [] as in Hashtable.
	/// Reverse lookup is through ReverseLookup().
	/// Adding and setting elements is done with forward syntax identical to
	/// in Hashtable, but both internal Hashtables are affected.
	/// The intention is for this to be used for constant kinds of lookups.
	/// If your data is rapidly changing, be careful not to push this
	/// class to hard, such as by getting the internal collections and
	/// editing them.
	/// The explicit conversions make it simple to get a BidirHashtable
	/// from another Hashtable (or other IDictionary).  There are no
	/// implicit conversions, however, because the cost to do so, and the
	/// fact that it results in new objects which are separate from the
	/// originals, should be taken into account.
	/// An example use for this class is to store a mapping of
	/// numerical enumerations which map to class types.  Then, at
	/// startup, this kind of table can be filled, and at runtime it
	/// can be looked up in either direction, depending on your
	/// activity.
	///
	///

	/// source file as the class itself.  (The remainder of the
	/// documentation may be edited.)
