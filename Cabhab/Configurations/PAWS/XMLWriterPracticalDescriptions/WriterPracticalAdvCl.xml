        <p>
            <content>This section considers the complements that can follow temporal and reason adverbs, which were introduced in sections </content>
            <sectionRef sec="sAdvPTemporal"/>
            <content> and </content>
            <sectionRef sec="sAdvPReason"/>
            <content>.  All of these adverbial clauses (or phrases) act the same as simple adverbs, so they will be considered adverbial phrases with the appropriate type of complement.  Adverbial clauses of these types normally may occur either sentence-initially or sentence-finally.</content>

                <content>English examples of temporal adverbs with complements used in full sentences include:</content>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <content>[Since then], John has been moody.</content>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <content>John has been home [since last week].</content>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <content>[Since John has been home from the hospital] he is doing better.</content>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <content>John is feeling fine [now that he is home from the hospital].</content>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <content>The dog followed Sue everywhere [when she returned from college].</content>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <content> [When she returned from college], the dog followed Sue everywhere.</content>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <content>These examples show that particular temporal adverbs allow certain types of complements.  In (1) </content>
                <langData>since</langData>
                <content> is followed by another temporal adverb, in (2) by a temporal nominal phrase, and in (3) it has a sentential complement.  Examples (5) and (6) show that </content>
                <langData>when</langData>
                <content> also takes a finite sentential complement, whereas </content>
                <langData>now</langData>
                <content> in (4) has a finite clausal complement with a complementizer.</content>

                <content>In </content>

            <p>
                <content>Turning now to adverbial phrases or clauses which express reason or purpose, we find adverbs which stand alone, such as </content>
                <langData>therefore</langData>
                <content> and </content>
                <langData>so</langData>
                <content>(which are sometimes considered sentential conjunctions), along with those that take various types of complement clauses.  English examples of reason or purpose adverbs which take clausal complements include:</content>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
