	<title>Coordination Constructions</title>
	<introduction>This section mainly considers basic coordination constructions where there is an overt conjunction between the conjuncts.  We will deal with coordination at the sentence level and at the verb phrase, nominal phrase, prepositional or postpositional phrase and adjective phrase levels. Then, at the nominal phrase level only, we will deal with lists and appositive constructions.  Finally, comparative constructions involving full sentences will be discussed. (Shorter comparatives were covered in <section number="9.5">Basic, Single-Clause Sentences - Comparatives</section>.)  More complex types of coordination constructions, such as gapping, and other possible levels of coordination will need to be dealt with later.</introduction>
	<form section="coord" transparent="no">
		<introduction>In English, the conjunctions which can be used between two conjuncts are <example>and</example>, <example>or</example>, <example>but</example> and <example>and/or</example>.  In addition, there are coordination constructions which require an initial conjunction, such as <example>either...or</example> and <example>neither...nor</example> constructions.  Some languages also use a word meaning <example>with</example> as a conjunction between nominal phrases.</introduction>

	   <instruction id="CoordAndOrInstruction">Note that a word like ‘and/or’ which is written with a slash (/) in the word, must be entered in your lexicon with a backslash in front of the slash (eg. ‘and\/or’) for <tool>CARLA Studio</tool> to process it correctly.</instruction>

	   <introduction>In general, coordination is between like categories.  For sentence-level coordination, this means that two declarative sentences may be conjoined, as in 1-2, or two questions, as in 3.  When the conjunction is the one meaning ‘but’, one of the conjuncts must be negative, as in 4.  English examples of full sentence coordination include:</introduction>
		<EnglishExample>
			<exItem label="1.">John went to the office this morning but he did not return.</exItem>
		   <exItem label="2.">Either I will come to the party or I will send my sister.</exItem>
		   <exItem label="3.">When did the mail come and where is my package?</exItem>
		   <exItem label="4.">John went to the office this morning but he did not return.</exItem>
		</EnglishExample>
		<prompt>Key examples of full sentence coordination in your language here:</prompt>
		<textBox id="CoordSent" dataItem="sentExample" rows="5"/>
		<br/>
		<introduction>Verb phrase coordination involves two full verb phrases that share a single subject.  English examples of verb phrase coordination, with the coordinates bracketed, include:</introduction>
		<EnglishExample>
			<exItem label="5.">Bill [ran the race] and [won the prize].</exItem>
			<exItem label="6.">I will [come to the party] or [send my sister].</exItem>
			<exItem label="7.">I will not [come to the party] nor [send my sister].</exItem>
		</EnglishExample>
		<prompt>Key examples of verb phrase coordination in your language here (without brackets):</prompt>
		<textBox id="CoordVP" dataItem="vpExample" rows="5"/>
		<br/>
	   <introduction>Coordinate nominal phrases can normally occur as subjects, objects, indirect objects and objects of a preposition or postposition, just like a regular nominal phrase.  English examples of nominal phrase coordination, with the coordinates bracketed, include:</introduction>
		<EnglishExample>
			<exItem label="8.">Bill ran in [the Boston Marathon] and [the Olympics].</exItem>
			<exItem label="9.">[My sister] or [I] will be there.</exItem>
			<exItem label="10.">Neither [my sister] nor [I] will be there.</exItem>
			<exItem label="11.">I will come to [the rehearsal] but not [the dinner].</exItem>
			<exItem label="12.">I will come to [the wedding] and/or [the reception].</exItem>
		</EnglishExample>
		<prompt>Key examples of nominal phrase coordination in your language here (without bracktes).  Include only examples with two conjucts and an overt conjunction between the conjuncts.  Other types of nominal phrase coordination will be dealt with on the next page.</prompt>
		<textBox id="CoordDP" dataItem="dpExample" rows="5"/>
		<br/>
	   <introduction>It is also normally possible to have coordinate prepositional or postpositional phrases in all the places that a regular such phrase normally occurs.  English examples with prepositional phrase coordination, with the coordinates bracketed, include:</introduction>
		<EnglishExample>
			<exItem label="13.">Bill ran [through the forest] and [over the bridge].</exItem>
			<exItem label="14.">I will come with you [to the rehearsal] but not [back home].</exItem>
			<exItem label="15.">I will come either [to the wedding] or [to the reception].</exItem>
		</EnglishExample>
	   <prompt>Key examples of <span id="PPPrepSpan" show="swPPPosPrep">prepositional</span>
		  <span id="PPPostSpan" show="swPPPosPost">postpositional</span>
		  <span id="PPBothSpan" show="swPPPosBoth">prepositional and/or postpositional</span> phrase coordination in your language here (without brackets):</prompt>
		<textBox id="CoordPP" dataItem="coordppExample" rows="5"/>
		<br/>
	   <introduction>Finally, adjectives or adjective phrases can usually be coordinated, both when they are modifying a noun, as in 16-18,  and when they are acting as the predicate adjective in a copular sentence, as in 19-20.  English examples of adjective phrase coordination, with the coordinates bracketed where not clear, include:</introduction>
		<EnglishExample>
			<exItem label="16.">The black and white dog belongs to my son.</exItem>
		   <exItem label="17.">My sister wants a [bright red] or [light blue] candle.</exItem>
		   <exItem label="18.">That looks like an [awfully painful] and [very dangerous] sore on your leg.</exItem>
		   <exItem label="19.">The sore on your leg is [awfully painful] and [very dangerous].</exItem>
		   <exItem label="20.">This material feels [very smooth] and [silky].</exItem>
