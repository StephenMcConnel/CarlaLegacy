    <title level="2">Pronouns - Demonstrative Pronouns</title>
    <introduction>Most languages have demonstrative pronouns that are related either to the demonstratives that modify a noun or to the locative adverbials.  The demonstrative pronouns specify the distance from the speaker and may have singular and plural forms.  English examples are <example>this, that, these</example> and <example>those</example>, which are identical to the demonstratives which modify a noun.  Demonstrative pronouns stand alone as the subject or object of a sentence, as in:
    </introduction>
    <EnglishExample>
        <exItem label="1.">Those are the books I asked for.</exItem>
        <exItem label="2.">Julie choose those.</exItem>
        <exItem label="3.">This is it.</exItem>
        <exItem label="4.">We like that.</exItem>
    </EnglishExample>
    <introduction>As seen in the examples above, English only has a single set of demonstratives to use in both subject and object position.  Some languages have distinct sets of demonstrative pronouns based on their case system.</introduction>
    <form section="pron">
        <prompt>Think about how your language would express examples similar to those given for English above, looking especially at the forms of the demonstrative pronouns that can appear in each position in the sentence.</prompt>

     <prompt>Does your language have different forms for the demonstrative pronouns when they are acting as subjects versus objects?</prompt>
     <radio id="PronDemCaseNo" dataValue="no">No, like English, the same forms can be used in either position</radio>
     <radio id="PronDemCaseYes" dataValue="yes">Yes, there are separate sets of demonstratives for the different positions based on case</radio>
