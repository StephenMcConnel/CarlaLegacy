	<title>Proper Names</title>
	<introduction> In English, some names can stand alone, like <example>Sue</example> or <example>Russia</example>.  Others are like compound nouns, such as <example>George Washington</example>.  Proper names may also contain articles and/or pre/post-positional phrases, as in <example>the United States of America</example>.  Many languages require an article before a name.  Appositives, possibly including a possessor, as in <example>my son, David</example>, also occur.  In addition, proper names can be modified by adjectives and relative clauses, as in <example>the good, old USA</example> or <example>the Susan Welch that I know</example>.</introduction>
