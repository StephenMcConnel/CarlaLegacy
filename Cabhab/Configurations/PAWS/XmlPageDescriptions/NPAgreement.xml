	<title level="2">Nominal Phrases - Agreement and Case</title>
	<introduction>Many languages require agreement between at least some of the modifiers and the head noun.  While English only has number agreement, in other languages this agreement may also include animacy, class, or gender.  The grammar rules generated by this starter kit include the constraints for full agreement, but if your language only has partial or no agreement, you simply will not add those features to your lexical items.  In that case, the constraints will only apply vacuously.  Based on your answers below about the agreement system in your language, you will be instructed to add the appropriate features in the sections that follow.</introduction>

		<introduction>Besides agreement, nouns and their modifiers may be marked for case.  Therefore, we need to know what case system, if any, your language uses.  You may have the situation (as is true for two fo the projects this starter kit was initially tested on) where the source language you wish to adapt from is unmarked or less marked for case than the target language(s) you wish to adapt into.  If so, you will need to add null allomorphs for the case markers in the source language to match the case markers in the target language(s) and allow the syntactic parser to disambiguate between these as much as possible.  If you have this situation, read the following information and answer the question(s) below based on the target language(s) case system.<br/>
			<br/>
The most common case system is nominative-accusative.  This is the system English has, though only pronouns are marked for case in English.  In a nominative-accusative system, subjects of both transitive and intransitive verbs are in nominative case, while direct objects are accusative case.  Possessors are genitive case.  The nominative pronouns in English are: <example>I, we, you, he, she, they</example>.  The accusative pronouns are: <example>me, us, you, him, her, them</example>.  The genitive pronouns include: <example>my, our, your, his, her, their</example>.  Therefore, we say <example>They hit him</example> and not <example>Them hit he</example>. <br/>
			<br/>
In an ergative-absolutive case system, subjects of transitive verbs are marked with the ergative case, while objects of transitive verbs and subjects of intransitive verbs are marked with the absolutive case.  The case of possessors is not set cross-linguistically, so if your language has an ergative-absolutive system, you will be asked about the case of possessors in <section number="5.4">Nominal Phrases - Possessors</section>.  Some languages with an ergative-absolutive system simply have different sets of verbal agreement markers, but no marking on nouns.  If this is true in your language, and there is also only a single set of stand-alone pronouns, answer "None" below.  If there are two sets of pronouns, however, as well as different sets of agreement markers, answer "Ergative-Absolutive" below.  The agreement marking will be handled separately in <section number="9.2">Basic, Single-clause Sentences - Inflection and Agreement Features</section>.<br/>
			<br/>
Some languages are even more complex in that they normally have a nominative-accusative system but under some conditions the case system switches to ergative-absolutive.  This is called "split ergativity".  In this starter kit, the best we can do for these languages is to add all the rules allowing both case systems.  Afterward, the specific constraints needed for your language can be added to the rules.
