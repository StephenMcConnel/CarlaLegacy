		<instruction id="IPIntranInstruction">Partial subcategorization can be done as follows, without entering a feature on every verb: if a particular verb is intransitive and can never have anything but a subject, mark it with the feature <feature>intransitive</feature>.  (Donâ€™t consider temporal elements.)  If it is an intransitive motion verb that can have a locative PP or AdvP <span id="IPIntranFollow" show="swHeadInitial">following</span>
			<span id="IPIntranPrecede" show="swHeadFinal">preceding</span> it, add the feature <feature>motion</feature> to its lexical entry.  Since the motion verbs are a small, closed set, the feature must be entered in the lexicon on the appropriate verbs; the default setting is <feature>-motion</feature>.</instruction>
