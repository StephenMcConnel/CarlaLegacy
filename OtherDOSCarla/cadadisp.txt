CADADISP.TXT Release notes for CADADISP

CADADISP is a an interlinear display program for CARLA files.
CADADISP is documented in the file CADADISP.DOC.

Change history:

0.4k Sep 1998 Created DJGPP, Win32, and 8086 versions.

0.4j Nov 95 adds a check and error report when an input line
exceeds the maximum line length. Also ported to DJGPP compiler to
make a 386 version and increased maximum line length to 50,000
(from 5,000) in the 386 version.

0.4h Jan 94 adds a -o option to give the output file name.  This was
done because the attempt to open an output file as a filter was
giving a "File open failed" message when run in a batch file from
the CARLA menu program.

0.4f Jul 91 further fixes the bug of eating digits off ambiguities whose
first morphname begins with a digit. Also fixes a bug which lost
the last lines of files when not wrapping.

0.4e Jul 91 fixes a bug which wrongly ate percent signs and
digits off ambiguities in which the first morphname began with a
digit.

0.4d Apr 91 enlarges the maximum length of each input line from
2500 to 5000.  It also makes the executable file of the program
smaller than it was.

0.4c Apr 91 speeds up the program greatly. For example, version
0.4b took over two minutes to make an output file of 50K.
Version 0.4c does the same file in less than 10 seconds.
