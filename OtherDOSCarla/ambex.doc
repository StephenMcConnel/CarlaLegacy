	   AMBEX (Ambiguity Extractor) Documentation

AMBEX is a filter to extract ambiguities from a file.

It accepts as input either an analysis file produced
by the AMPLE program, or a synthesis file produced by
the STAMP program.

If the input is an analysis file, then the output file
includes every \a and \d line with an ambiguity.

If the input is a synthesis file, then the output file
includes all ambiguous words, one per line.

For example, the following input:

	This is a %2%line%sentence% of %2%sample%example% text.

produces the following output:

	%2%line%sentence%
	%2%sample%example%

The ambiguity character can be changed with the -a option
on the command line.  For example, the following command
uses dollar sign as the ambiguity marker:
	ambex -a $ input >output

The upper and lower bounds of ambiguity to be included can
be changed with the -u and -l options.  (They default to zero
lower bound, which includes failures, and unlimited upper bound.)
For example, the following command chooses only words with two
and three way ambiguities:
	ambex -l 2 -u 3 input >output
