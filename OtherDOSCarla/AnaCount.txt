			  ANACOUNT v. 1.0.0
	 A Simple-Minded Tool for Calculating Analysis Counts
		   Andy Black, 13-Mar-2000

AnaCount is a simple-minded filter for displaying AMPLE-like
statistics for an arbitrary ANA file.  It was written as a
way to help evaluate the effectiveness of disambiguation
tools such as SenTrans and PC-PATR.

It takes an ANA file as standard input and reports the
AMPLE-like stats on standard output.  For example, running
this:

		anacount < myfile.ana > stats

calculates the statistics in myfile.ana and puts the
following in the stats file:

ANALYSIS STATISTICS:  129 words processed.
   Ambiguity Levels:
						1 word  with  0 analyses.
					  100 words with  1 analysis.
					   16 words with  2 analyses.
						6 words with  3 analyses.
						2 words with  4 analyses.
						2 words with  6 analyses.
						1 word  with  8 analyses.
						1 word  with 13 analyses.
   Percentage of analyzed words ambiguous: 21%
   Excess ambiguities over analyzed words: 49%
