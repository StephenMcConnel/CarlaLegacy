LEXTRANS.TXT Release Notes for LEXTRANS Lexical Transfer

LEXTRANS does lexical transfer to convert morphnames from source
to target based on a combined dictionary. LEXTRANS is documented
in the file LEXTRANS.DOC.

Change history:

0.2w Mar 2001 Fixed bug which did not manage memory properly for properties
in rules.

0.2v Oct 2000 Fixed bug whereby Lextrans was not allowing *just* category
changing: When only '-p' replace categories is selected, the rule file was
processing as having no rules.

0.2u Sep 2000 Increased temporary memory work space size from 63000 to
640000.  This should prevent LexTrans from running out of memory when
loading large rule sets.

0.2t Jul 2000 Fix bug which did not pass on \u field in ANA file.

0.2s Mar 2000 Limit of 2000 characters per line is too small for some
  large ambiguities.  Increased it to 10000.

0.2r Jan 2000 Various internal handling improvements.  Nothing visible
  to the user.

0.2p Sep 1998 Added compile time display.  Created DJGPP, Win32, and
8086 versions.  Conformed monitoring display to new standard.

0.2o Dec 95 Add -q option to replace properties through dictionary.

0.2n Dec 95 transmits the \p field from source to target.

0.2m Nov 95 ports to the DJGPP compiler to make a 386 version.

0.2k Jun 95 adds the ability to ignore noload records.  For this
to happen LEXTRANS needed to load the Analysis Code Table file to
find out what the noload markers are.  A -f command line option
was added that tells LEXTRANS to read an AMPLE command file
containing among other things the name of the code table file.
LEXTRANS also reads the root dictionary filenames from the
command file, rather than using the -d command line option.  If
the -f option is not used the program behaves as before.

0.2j Mar 95 fixes a bug in 0.2h that prevented Lextrans from
running on an XT.

0.2h Mar 95 fixes a bug which caused a change rule to be
generated for only the last target and source word in a record
containing multiple target and/or source words. 0.2h corrects
this by generating change rules for all target and source words
in a record.

0.2g Feb 94 adds a -p option to replace categories as well as
roots. It is used to convert from source to target categories. To
use it, give the category field marker after the -p option. This
option can also convert only categories and not roots. To do that
use a -p option and no -n option.

0.2f Jun 93 further fixes the bug which was partly fixed by
version 0.2e.

0.2e May 93 fixes a bug in which source words that started with
an upper ASCII character failed to match.

0.2d Mar 93 greatly increases the dictionary storage space.
Versions previous to 0.2d recognized dictionary markers only if
they were followed by a space. Version 0.2d allows nl or tab
after the marker.

0.2c Mar 93 puts the version header and a statistical summary
into the log file.  0.2c also exits with an error if no
dictionary entries are found, or if no change rules are found, or
if the source and target marks are the same, or if no output file
is given.

0.2b Mar 93 fixes a bug which could cause the program to hang
when morphnames to be transferred contained extended ASCII
characters.  0.2b also fixes a bug which caused the output file
to have extra carriage returns in it.

0.2a Nov 92 adds a -c command line option to give the comment
character for dictionaries.
