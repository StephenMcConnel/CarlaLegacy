		<instruction>In the lexicon, add the following features to the adverb entry, in addition to the feature <feature>temporal</feature>.  Note that the first two features can be added to the same entry, or either or both can be added to the third or fourth sets of features.
<ul>
				<li>If the adverb may have another adverb as its complement, add the feature <feature>takes_Adv</feature>.</li>
				<li>If the adverb may have a nominal phrase complement, add the feature <feature>takes_DP</feature>.</li>
				<li>If the adverb may have an IP complement, add the features <feature>sentential embedded_finite</feature>.</li>
				<li>If the adverb requires a complementizer to be present in its sentential complement (CP), add the features <feature>sentential embedded_finite embedded_CP</feature>.</li>

		<introduction>Turning now to adverbial phrases or clauses which express reason or purpose, we find adverbs which stand alone, such as <example>therefore</example> and <example>so</example>, along with those that take various types of complement clauses.  (Examples such as <example>for this reason</example> and <example>on purpose</example> should work based on your answers in <section number="8">Pre/post-positional Phrases</section>.)
</introduction>
		<EnglishExample>
			<exItem>English examples of reason or purpose adverbs which take clausal complements include:</exItem>
			<exItem label="1.">John rushed to the hospital [because Sue was in an accident].</exItem>
			<exItem label="2.">[Since Jill said that she likes him], Joe smiles all the time.</exItem>
			<exItem label="3.">Bill rushed to the airport [so that he could see Kay before she left].</exItem>
			<exItem label="4.">The troops threw grenades at the enemy [in order to escape].</exItem>
			<exItem label="5.">The troops threw grenades at the enemy [in order for the prisoners to escape].</exItem>
		</EnglishExample>
		<introduction>In the examples above, <example>because</example> and <example>since</example> take only finite IP complements and <example>so</example> takes a finite CP complement.  In contrast, <example>in order</example> takes either a nonfinite IP with a pro-dropped subject or a nonfinite CP complement.  This is the same subcategorization as shown for <example>like</example> and <example>hate</example> in <section number="10">Complement Clauses</section>.  <br/>
			<br/>(Note again that if your language has any multi-word forms, like <example>in order</example>, they need be handled as a single lexical entry using <tool>Join Compound</tool>.)
