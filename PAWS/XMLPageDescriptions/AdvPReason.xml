	<title level="2">Adverbs and AdvP - Reason or Purpose Adverbs</title>
	<introduction>Reason or purpose adverbs include <example>therefore</example> and
<example>so</example>.  Reason or purpose can also be expressed by a
prepositional phrase, such as <example>for this reason</example> or <example>on purpose</example>, and
by an adverbial clause beginning with <example>because</example> or <example>since</example> or <example>in order</example>.  Reason or purpose adverbs do not allow modifiers (at least in English).  The structure of these adverbial clauses will be addressed in <section number="13">Adverbial Clauses</section>.
