	<title>Pronouns</title>
	<introduction>Pronouns come in various types, including personal pronouns, possessives, reflexives, reciprocals,  and indefinites.  These pronouns normally stand alone in the place of a nominal phrase, but they can also be modified by a partitive phrase and in some languages may be modified by determiners and quantifiers.  Each of these types and issues will be looked at in turn.
<br/>
		<br/>
The main task for pronouns is to add all the relevant features in the lexicon for case and agreement and pronoun type.  Personal pronouns normally have either more than or the same number of case and agreement features as nouns have.  </introduction>
