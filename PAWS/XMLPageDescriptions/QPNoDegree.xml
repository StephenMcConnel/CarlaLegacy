	<title level="2">Quantifiers and QP - No Degree Words</title>
	<instruction>In the lexicon, mark this type of quantifier with the feature <feature>Q</feature>.
This will change their category to <category>Q</category> for the syntax. If a particular
quantifier can only go with plural nouns, add the feature <feature>plural</feature> to
that entry.  Also, mark any words which can modify them with the
features <feature>Deg modifies_Q</feature>.  Note that these degree words will most
likely not be the same as the ones which can modify an NP above.
