		<prompt>Think of similar examples from your language and key them here:</prompt>
		<textBox id="IPExamplesExample" dataItem="example" cols="50"/>
<instruction>If a verb is transitive and it's object must always be present, add the feature <feature>transitive</feature> to its lexical entry.  Do not mark a verb like <example>eat</example> which may or may not have an overt object.</instruction>
		<introduction>Ditransitives can have the second object expressed as a PP or as a nominal phrase (DP).  Some languages, like English, allow both (via Dative Movement as in 4. below).  Some English examples of ditransitives are given below.</introduction>
		<EnglishExample>
			<exItem label="1.">The girl bought the present for her mother.</exItem>
			<exItem label="2.">The man sold his car for two thousand dollars.</exItem>
<exItem label="3.">The girl gave the gift to her mother.</exItem>
<exItem label="4.">The girl gave her mother the gift.</exItem>

	<radio id="IPTransDiCatDP" dataValue="dp">DP only</radio>
	<radio id="IPTransDiCatBoth" dataValue="both">Either a DP or a PP (as in English)</radio>
</radioGroup>
<instruction>Any verbs which require the second object to always be present should be marked with the feature <feature>ditransitive</feature>.  Those which allow the second object, but it is optional, can be marked <feature>transitive</feature>.</instruction>
