		<instruction>
   You need to make sure the adverbs in your lexicon will be mapped to the syntactic category <category>Adv</category>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
				<li>If you already have adverbs marked with the category <category>Adv</category> in your lexicon, nothing
  more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If adverbs are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>Adv</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makeAdv</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.</li>
				<li>If you have adverbs marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <category>Adv</category>, enter that category below so PAWS can map your morphological category to <category>Adv</category>. <br/>
					<catMap id="AdvPAdverbCategory" dataItem="adverbCategory">Adv</catMap>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>Run the file <file id="AdvPTestingFile" section="AdvP">advtest.txt</file> through your morphological parser and then
run the syntactic parser on the output.  Check the log browser for the
results and note any changes you need to make to the lexicon or to
answers about the order of elements in the phrase structure
rules. Make the changes as needed and rerun.</p>

Please check off this section now in 'Contents' and then proceed to
the Adjectives and AdjP section when you are ready.</p>
