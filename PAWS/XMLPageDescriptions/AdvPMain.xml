	<title>Adverbs and AdvP</title>
	<introduction>Adverbs express four basic types of information:
<ul>
			<li> time,</li>
			<li> location,</li>
			<li>manner, and</li>
			<li>reason.</li>
		</ul>
These types have different characteristics as to
which positions they may occupy and how they may be modified, so they
need to be distinguished from each other by a feature.
We'll deal with each in turn.
</introduction>
	<introduction>Temporal adverbs include the English words: <example>already</example>, <example>then</example>, <example>soon</example>, <example>now</example>,
<example>later</example>, and <example>always</example>.  Think of similar words in your language.  These need
to be distinguished from other types of words or phrases that can also
express the time in a sentence, such as: nominal phrases <example>yesterday</example>,
<example>last night</example>, <example>next year</example>, <example>tomorrow</example>, <example>a long time ago</example>; prepositional
phrases <example>for a long time</example>, <example>in a little while</example>, <example>at 10 o</example>clock'; and
adverbial clauses <example>while you are working</example>, <example>when Sue arrived</example>.
</introduction>
