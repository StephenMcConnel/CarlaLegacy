		 <instruction>You need to make sure the conjunctions in your lexicon which occur between the conjuncts will be mapped to the syntactic category <category>Conj</category>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
				<li>If you already have conjunctions marked with the category <category>Conj</category> in your lexicon, nothing
  more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If conjunctions are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>Conj</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makeConj</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.</li>
				<li>If you have conjunctions marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <category>Conj</category>, enter that category below so PAWS can map your morphological category to <category>Conj</category>. <br/>
					<catMap id="CoordConjunctionCategory" dataItem="conjunctionCategory">Conj</catMap>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
Add the feature <feature>makeInitialConj</feature> to any conjunction words like 'either' and 'neither' which occur before the first conjunct rather than between the conjuncts.
	   <br/>
Run the file coordtest.txt through your morphological parser and then
run the syntactic parser on the output.  Check the log for the
results and note any changes you need to make to the lexicon or to
answers about the order of elements in the phrase structure
rules. Make the changes as needed and rerun.<br/>
