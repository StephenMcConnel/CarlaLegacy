	<title level="2">Nominal Phrase - Noun Compounds and Complements</title>
	<introduction>Many languages are like English, in that they have noun modifiers. Normally, we simply think that all nouns can also be used as adjectives, but a closer look reveals that true adjectives come before the noun modifier, as in <example>large, round [syrup bottle]</example> but not <example>*round, syrup large bottle</example>.  Therefore, we will treat noun modifiers as compound nouns which are written as separate words.<br/>
		<br/>In the English examples above, <example>bottle</example> is clearly the head noun rather than <example>syrup</example>, because "syrup" is restricting the type of "bottle", not the other way around.  In all compound nouns and noun modifier constructions in English, the head is the right-most noun in the series.</introduction>
	<form section="np">
		<prompt>Key one or more examples with noun modifiers or compound nouns written as separate words in the box.  If you write all noun compounds as single words, key a few of those examples used in a phrase here:</prompt>
		<textBox id="NPCompExample" dataItem="compExample"/><br/>
<br/>
		<introduction>Now consider pre/post-positional phrase (PP) modifiers (or complements), such as in <example>the large, round bottle [of syrup]</example> or <example>the boyâ€™s letter [to that girl]</example>.  Also include examples of genitive pre/post-positional phrases that take the place of the possessor, such as <example>those dogs [of his]</example> or <example>the tablecloth [of my mother's]</example></introduction> <br/>

		<prompt>Key your examples of pre/post-positional phrases modifying nouns here (without the brackets):</prompt>

		<introduction>Refer to both of the above sets of data for the following questions.  It may be the case that your language does not have any compound nouns or noun modifiers that are written as separate words, depending on orthographic issues.</introduction>
