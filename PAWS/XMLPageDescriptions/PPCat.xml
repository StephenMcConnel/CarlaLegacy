<instruction>You need to make sure the pre/post-positions in your lexicon will be mapped to the syntax category <category>P</category>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
	<li>If you already have pre/post-positions marked with the category <category>P</category> in your lexicon nothing more needs to be done.</li>
<li>If you have pre/postpositions marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <category>P</category>, go to the <tool>Category Mapper</tool> and map your morphological category to <category>P</category>.</li>
<li>If pre/post-positions are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you need to add the feature <feature>P</feature> to each appropriate entry so the category will be changed.</li>
