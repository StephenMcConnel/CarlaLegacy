		<instruction id="IPAuxYesInstruction" show="swAuxYes">The auxiliary elements need to have the category <category>Aux</category>.  If a particular form can also stand alone as the main verb in the sentence, you need to have two separate entries, one with the category <category>Aux</category> and one with the category <category>V</category>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
				<li>If you already have auxiliaries marked with the category <category>Aux</category> in your lexicon nothing more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If auxiliaries are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>Aux</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makeAux</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.</li>
				<li>If you have auxiliaries marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <category>Aux</category>, enter that category below so PAWS can map your morphological category to <category>Aux</category>.<br/>

		<instruction>You need to make sure the verbs in your lexicon will be mapped to the syntactic category <category>V</category>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
				<li>If you already have verbs marked with the category <category>V</category> in your lexicon, nothing
  more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If verbs are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>V</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makeV</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.</li>
				<li>If you have verbs marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <category>V</category>, enter that category below so PAWS can map your morphological category to <category>V</category>. <br/>

				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Run the file <file id="IPTestingFile" section="IP">iptest.txt</file> through your morphological parser and then
run the syntactic parser on the output.  Check the log for the
results and note any changes you need to make to the lexicon or to
answers about the order of elements in the phrase structure
rules. Make the changes as needed and rerun.  The examples with nonfinite auxiliaries in embedded clauses will not be able to be tested until <section number="10">Complement Clauses</section> is completed. </p>

Please check off this section now in 'Contents' and then proceed to
<section number="10">Complement Clauses</section> when you are ready.</p>
