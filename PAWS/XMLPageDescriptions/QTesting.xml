		<instruction>You need to make sure the interrogative words which act as pronouns in your lexicon will be mapped to the syntactic category <category>Pron</category>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation (be sure that you have also entered the feature <feature>wh</feature> on each entry as directed earlier):
<ul>
				<li>If you already have these interrogative pronouns marked with the category <category>Pron</category> in your lexicon, nothing more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If the interrogative pronouns are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>Pron</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makePron</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.</li>
				<li>If you have the interrogative pronouns marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, even if it includes the other interrogative words since they were mapped individually to their appropriate syntactic category, enter that category below so PAWS can map your morphological category to <category>Pron</category>. <br/>
					<catMap id="QWhPronCategory" dataItem="whPronCategory">Pron</catMap>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
Run the file qtest.txt through your morphological parser and then
run the syntactic parser on the output.  Check the log for the
results and note any changes you need to make to the lexicon or to
answers about the order of elements in the phrase structure
rules. Make the changes as needed and rerun.<br/>

Please check off this section now in 'Contents' and then proceed to
<section number="12">Relative Clauses</section> when you are ready.
