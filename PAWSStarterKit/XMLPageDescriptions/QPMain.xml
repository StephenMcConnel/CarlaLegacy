	<title>Quantifiers and QP</title>
	<introduction>Most languages have three sets of quantifiers:
<ul>
			<li>Those meaning <example>all</example>,</li>
			<li>other quantifiers such as <example>many</example>
or <example>few</example>, and</li>
			<li>numbers.</li>
		</ul>
We'll deal with each in turn.
</introduction>
	<introduction>Quantifiers meaning <example>all</example> seem to be a category of their
own.  They usually occur first, in a position distinct from
the other quantifiers, but in the same place as degree words
like <example>only</example> and <example>just</example>.
</introduction>
	<instruction>Look for examples in your language like the following:</instruction>
	<EnglishExample>
		<exItem>Example English quantifier phrases:</exItem>
		<exItem label="1">
			<u>all</u> (of) the children.</exItem>
		<exItem label="2">
			<u>all</u> five children.</exItem>
		<exItem label="3">
			<u>all</u> (of) John's young children.</exItem>
		<exItem label="4">
			<u>only</u> a few sad children.</exItem>
		<exItem label="5">
			<u>just</u> this many children.</exItem>
		<exItem label="6">
			<u>just</u> these two bright children.</exItem>
		<exItem label="7">
			<u>only</u> Sue's three children.</exItem>
	</EnglishExample>
	<form>
		<prompt>Key your examples here:</prompt>
		<textBox id="QPExample"/>
		<codeInfo>These go in nptest.txt</codeInfo>
		<instruction>If you have words like <example>all</example>, <example>only</example>, and <example>just</example> which
occur either initially or finally in the nominal phrase,
mark these words as <feature>Deg modifies_NP</feature> in the lexicon.  Note
that this is two separate features with a space between
them.  The first will change their syntactic category to <category>Deg</category>
and the second adds the feature to distinguish them as the
type that modifies NPs.<br/>
			<br/>
Also, mark the word or words meaning <example>all</example> with the feature
<feature>plural</feature> and the feature <feature>quantifier</feature>.
