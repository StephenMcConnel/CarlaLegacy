  <title>Adverbs and AdvP</title>
  <introduction>Adverbs express four basic types of information:
<ul>
	  <li> time,</li>
	  <li> location,</li>
	  <li>manner,</li>
	  <li>and reason.</li>
	</ul>
These types have different characteristics as to
which positions they may occupy and how they may be modified, so they
need to be distinguished from each other by a feature.
We'll deal with each in turn.
</introduction>
  <introduction>Temporal adverbs include the English words: <example>already</example>, <example>then</example>, <example>soon</example>, <example>now</example>,
<example>later</example>, and <example>always</example>.  Think of similar words in your language.  These need
to be distinguished from other types of words or phrases that can also
express the time in a sentence, such as: nominal phrases <example>yesterday</example>,
<example>last night</example>, <example>next year</example>, <example>tomorrow</example>, <example>a long time ago</example>; prepositional
phrases <example>for a long time</example>, <example>in a little while</example>, <example>at 10 o</example>clock'; and
adverbial clauses <example>while you are working</example>, <example>when Sue arrived</example>.
</introduction>
  <EnglishExample>
	<exItem>Example English temporal adverbial phrases:</exItem>
	<exItem label="1.">very soon.</exItem>
	<exItem label="2.">much later.</exItem>
	<exItem label="3.">only now.</exItem>
  </EnglishExample>
  <instruction>Think of examples of temporal adverbs and include any degree words which can modify them.</instruction>

	<instruction>In the lexicon, key the feature <feature>temporal</feature> on all adverbs that express
time.  You can also add this feature to nouns such as <example>night</example>, <example>year</example>,
<example>day</example>, <example>yesterday</example>, <example>tomorrow</example>, <example>time</example>, <example>while</example> (the noun, we'll deal later with
the complementizer for an adverbial clause), and <example>o'clock</example>.
