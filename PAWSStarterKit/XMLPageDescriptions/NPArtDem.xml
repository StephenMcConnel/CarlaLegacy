	<title level="2">Nominal Phrase - Articles and Demonstratives</title>
<introduction>Now consider articles and demonstratives.  In English, the articles are <example>a</example>, <example>an</example>, and <example>the</example>.  English demostratives include <example>this</example>, <example>that</example>, <example>these</example>, and <example>those</example>.  Some simple examples are:</introduction>
<EnglishExample>
	<exItem label="1.">a book.</exItem>
<exItem label="2.">an apple.</exItem>
<exItem label="3.">the book.</exItem>
<exItem label="4.">the books.</exItem>
<exItem label="5.">this apple.</exItem>
<exItem label="6.">those books.</exItem>
</EnglishExample>
<introduction>In English, articles and demonstratives do not co-occur in the same nominal phrase, and both occur before the noun.  They may be able to co-occur in your language, or they may occur in different positions with respect to the noun.  Therefore, we will give them different syntactic categories.</introduction>
