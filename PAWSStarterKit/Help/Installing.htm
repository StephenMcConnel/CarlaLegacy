<h2>1 Requirements</h2>
<p>The PAWS Starter Kit uses the new XML/XSLT technologies in conjunction with the Internet Explorer browser.  While this has greatly sped up the development time, it does mean you have to have certain software available on your machine.</p>
	  <p>To use the PAWS Starter Kit, you will need to have:
<ul>
	<li>Internet Explorer 5.0 or 5.5.
<p>If you have IE 5.5, then you may also need the MSXML3 package.</p>
<p>If you have IE 5.0, then you will also need to have:
<ol>
	<li>The Windows Installer (instmsi.exe) and</li>
<li>The MSXML3 package (msxml3.exe)</li>
</ol></p></li>
<li>The PAWS Starter Kit install package which consists of these files:
<ul>
	<li>setup.exe</li>
<li>setup.lst</li>
<li>PAWSSt1.CAB</li>
<li>PAWSSt2.CAB</li>
<li>PAWSSt3.CAB</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>2 Installation</h2>
<h3>2.1 For Internet Explorer 5.5</h3>
<p>Unless you already have the latest version of the MSXML3 package installed, then you will need to install it.  You install it by invoking the msxml3.exe program and following the instructions on the screen.  You may also need to run the Xmlinst.exe program to ensure that it will use the latest version (and not some earlier version) of the MSXML3 package.</p>
<h3>2.2 For Internet Explorer 5.0</h3>
<p>You must first install the windows installer, then the MSXML3 package before installing the PAWS Starter Kit.  Follow these steps once you have the instmsi.exe and msxml3.exe programs:
<ol>
	<li>Install the Windows Installer by invoking the instmsi.exe program and following the instructions on the screen.</li>
<li>Install the MSXML3 package by invoking the msxml3.exe program and following the instructions on the screen.</li>
</ol></p>
<h3>2.3 For the PAWS Starter Kit</h3>
<p>Invoke the setup.exe program and follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
<h2>3 Running the PAWS Starter Kit</h2>
<p>The PAWS Starter Kit is a windows program like most other windows programs.  You can find it by going to Start / Programs / PAWS Starter Kit / PAWS Starter Kit.  You can also create a desktop short-cut to it.  One way to do this is to navigate via the Windows Explorer to where you placed the program (the default is <i>C:\Program Files\PAWSStarterKit</i>).  Go to the <i>Container</i> subdirectory.  Right click on PAWSStarterContainer.exe and select Create Shortcut.  Then drag the shortcut to your desktop.</p>
<h3>3.1 First time running the PAWS Starter Kit</h3>
<p>The very first time you run the PAWS Starter Kit, it will give a message saying that it is creating a new PAWS language project.  There are three steps in this:
<ol>
	<li>You will be asked to enter the name of the language and a three letter abbreviation for it (this can be like what you do for CarlaStudio).</li>
<li>You'll then be given a chance to select the font you want to use for your vernacular data.</li>
<li>After that you will be asked to save the data in a file.  We suggest you put the data in some directory other than the one where it will initially default to (which is where the PAWS Starter Kit stores its invariable data).  It could even go in the same directory where your CarlaStudio data is, if you want.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>After these initial steps, you will see the main screen, displaying the table of contents.  In theory, it is self-explanatory.  You'll have to tell us, though, whether the theory is right...</p>
<p>We do suggest that you initially check out the purpose statement.  (It is the "Click <u>here</u> to see a purpose statement." near the top.)</p>
<h3>3.2 Marking words in the Lexicon</h3>

<p>Throughout the PAWS Starter Kit pages, you'll see instructions in
red.  When these say things like, "<span style="color:red">mark these
words as <span style="color:blue" style="font-family:Courier New">Deg
modifies_NP</span> in the lexicon</span>," it means to add a field to
your appropriate AMPLE dictionary record(s) which contains the words
"Deg modifies_NP".</p>

<p>The standard code that CarlaStudio produced by default is "\f" (for
"features").  If you use this code, you would key the field like
this:<br/>

<span style="font-family:Courier New">\f Deg modifies_NP</span>

<p>You can certainly use whatever code you wish.  Just make sure that
you enter your code in all the dictionary SFM marker mappings in
the language model portion of CarlaStudio (language model / dictionary
tab).</p>

<h3>3.3 Using PC-PATR in CarlaStudio</h3>
<p>At some point we assume you will want to try and use the results of the PAWS Starter Kit with your CarlaStudio set up.  Here is what we suggest:
<ol>
	<li>In CarlaStudio, go to the language model / Language / Analysis Sequence...</li>
<li>Click on the last process in the list (which may well be SENT Disambig) and then click on the Insert After button.  (By the way, you will probably want to disable the SENT Disambig process so you can better tell just how effective the syntactic approach is.)</li>
<li>In the resulting Choose a Processor... dialog, click on PC-PATR DLL and then click the OK button.</li>
<li>You should now see a PC-PATR Disambiguate processor in the list.  Select this (it probably already is) and click on the Properties button.</li>
<li>You will now see the PCPATR DLL dialog box.  Click on the Browse button and navigate to where you have stored your PAWS Starter Kit data.  Select the xxxPatr.grm file (where xxx is your language abbreviation).</li>
<li>We suspect that you will want to keep the other options in the PCPATR DLL dialog as they are.  You can check the online PCPATR reference manual if you want to know more about these options.  (In CarlaStudio, go to Help / Help Topics / Other Documentation / Online documentation for the CARLA tools and then scroll down to where it has the PC-PATR Reference manual and click on the small grey box by it.) </li>
</ol></p>
<p>The next time you process a file, it will also invoke PC-PATR and apply the rules created by the PAWS Starter Kit.</p>
<h2>4 Special Notes for Version 0.2.4 Alpha</h2>
<h3>4.1 This is alpha software</h3>
<p>This means that it is not complete (i.e. it does not have all the functionality we plan for it to have).</p>
<p>It also means we fully realize that we have not fully tested it (i.e. we won't be shocked if there are bugs).  Please make a list of all problems, questions, and suggestions you have on it.  Your feedback is greatly appreciated!</p>
<h3>4.2 The Help File</h3>
<p>In this version there is only one help file (other than this one).  It is a WinWord version of Cheri's Introduction to GB that appeared in several volumes of Notes on Linguistics.  There are several places in the PAWS Starter Kit where it says to "Click here to see more on X".   Clicking on that link will have the program load in Cheri's file and jump to the appropriate section (assuming you have WinWord installed on your machine).</p>
<p><b>Note for IE 5.0 users</b>:  This seems to work fine on machines running IE 5.5.  On machines with IE 5.0, however, it ends up crashing the PAWS Starter Kit.  At this point, I do not know why it behaves this way.  If you have IE5.0, you can always just use WinWord to edit the file (it is in the Help subdirectory).  You can then use Edit / Go To / select bookmarks and choose the one that sounds like the one you're interested in (you can ignore all the xDDD example number bookmarks).</p>
<h3>4.3 Auxiliary Tools</h3>
<p>The PAWS Starter Kit makes mention of three auxiliary tools.  Unfortunately, only one of them exists as of May 4, 2001.</p>
<h4>4.3.1 The Log Browser Tool</h4>

<p>Every section (except the first) ends with a Testing page.  This
page mentions a tool called the Log Browser.  Morris Johnson of PNG is
currently developing this tool.  As of May 4, 2001, version 0.2a
(alpha) is available.  The Log Browser is designed to
make the output of PC-PATR much easier to read.  Click <a
href="LogBrowserReadMe.txt">here</a> to read an introduction on the
Log Browser tool.  <i>Note that it requires IE 5.5 to use it.</i></p>

<h4>4.3.2 The Category Mapper Tool</h4>
<p>Some sections mention a Category Mapper tool.  It does not yet exist.  We are hoping that Morris will work on this after he completes the Log Browser.  This tool is intended to simplify the process of making the categories you've used coincide with the ones the PAWS Starter Kit grammar file will assume.</p>
<p>Beginning with version 0.2.3, we've added a temporary solution.  Create a file called XXXCatMap.txt and put it wherever your XXXPatr.grm file is (for both files, XXX means whatever language abbreviation you are using).  This file will get appended to the XXXPatr.grm file whenever you save your PAWS language project.</p>
<p>In the XXXCatMap.txt file, type entries like this:<br>
<span style="font-family:Courier New">
Let xxx be&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;cat&gt; = !Num <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head type ordinal&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;= !-<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;head&nbsp;type&nbsp;wh&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;!-<br>
</span>
where xxx is whatever your AMPLE category is (case sensitive) and the category  after the exclamation point is whatever it needs to be according to the starterkit.   The other lines are the default values per the Let statement in the XXXPatr.grm file.  This tells the program to map whatever your category was to the category Num plus all the appropriate defaults.</p>
<p>
This type of mapping will have to be done for every AMPLE category you have that either doesn't already match the syntactic category or isn't mapped by a feature.
</p>
<h4>4.3.3 The Feature Template Editor Tool</h4>
<p>This is another hoped-for tool to make managing PC-PATR's templates easier.</p>
<h3>4.4 The Writer portion of PAWS</h3>
<p>The automatic grammar writer portion of the PAWS concept has not been implemented yet.  We would like your opinion on one aspect of this: how would you feel if the resulting file was in html format (like this file is)?  Would that be just fine or would it be problematic for your situation?</p>
