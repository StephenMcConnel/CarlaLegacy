<h2>Quantifiers and QP - Cardinal Numbers</h2>
<div class="introduction">
<p>Now consider cardinal numbers.  They cannot be modified by the
degree words like the quantifiers can, though they occur in the same
position.  Note, however, that cardinal numbers can be modified by
ordinal numbers and by <span class="example">next</span> and <span class="example">last</span>, as in <span class="example">the first twenty boys</span> or
<span class="example">the next one hundred years</span>.  Since these modifiers also act as regular
adjectives in modifying nouns directly, they will need to have the
syntactic category of adjectives plus a feature to distinguish them.

<form action="--WEBBOT-SELF--" method="post">Key your examples here:<br><TEXTAREA class=vernacular id=QPCardinalExample style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in" rows=7 wrap=off cols=40></TEXTAREA><!--go in qtest.txt, too-->

<p class="introduction">Further, larger cardinal numbers can be compounds which may be
written as separate words, such as <span class="example">one hundred thirty three</span>.  In
addition, some languages allow two numbers to occur side by side, such
as <span class="example">two three</span> to mean <span class="example">a few</span>.

<br><div class="instruction">
<p>You need to make sure the cardinal number words in your lexicon will be mapped to the syntax category <span class="category">Num</span>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation, and check it off when it is completed:
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.025in">
<li>If you already have numbers marked with the category <span class="category">Num</span> in your lexicon nothing
  more needs to be done.

<li>If you have numbers marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <span class="category">Num</span>, go to the <span class="tool">Category Mapper</span> and map your morphological category to <span class="category">Num</span>.

<li>If numbers are mixed in with another category in the lexicon (e.g. adjectives), you need to add the feature <span class="feature">Num</span> to each appropriate entry so the category will be changed.</li>
