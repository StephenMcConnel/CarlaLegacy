<h2>Adverbs and AdvP - Locative Adverbs</h2>
<div class="introduction">
<p>Locative adverbs include the English words: <span class="example">here</span>, <span class="example">there</span>, <span class="example">everywhere</span>.
In English, location is often also expressed by a prepositional
phrase, such as: <span class="example">in the mountains</span>, <span class="example">at San Jose</span>, <span class="example">over there</span>.  Many
languages allow just a nominal phrase, consisting of a proper noun or
description of the place.
