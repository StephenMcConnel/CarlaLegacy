<p>In the lexicon, mark the adjectives that can only go with animate nouns with the feature <span class="feature">animate</span>. Mark the adjectives that can only go with inanimate nouns with the feature <span class="feature">-animate</span>.  Do not add any animacy agreement feature to those which can go with either animate or inanimate nouns.  Or, if animacy agreement is specified by an affix, mark the affix(es) with the appropriate feature(s).
<br><br>If your language also has person agreement, in the lexicon add the person features <span class="feature">first</span> (with <span class="feature">exclusive</span> or <span class="feature">inclusive</span> added after a space if distinguished in your language), <span class="feature">second</span> or <span class="feature">third</span> to any adjectives that can only go with that type of noun or pronoun. If the person agreement features are specified by affixes, mark the affixes with the appropriate features instead.  (If your language does not have this type of agreement, simply do not add any features.)
<br><br>If your language also has number agreement: in the lexicon, mark the adjectives that can only go with singular nouns with the feature <span class="feature">singular</span>.  Mark the those that can only go with plural nouns with the feature <span class="feature">plural</span>.  Do not add any feature for number agreement to ones which can go with either singular or plural nouns.  Note: if your language makes a further distinction for dual marking, add the feature <span class="feature">dual</span> to the appropriate entries. If the number agreement features are specified by affixes, mark the affixes with the appropriate features instead.  (If your language does not have this type of agreement, simply do not add any features.)

</div><div class="instruction" id="AdjPAgreeYesClassInstruction">
<p>In the lexicon, mark the adjectives that can only go with a particular class with the feature <span class="feature">class_##</span>, where ## is replaced by a number between 1 and 99.  It may be the case that the same affixes that mark the class number on adjectives (and possibly articles and demonstratives too) also mark the class number on nouns.  If this is the case in your language, simply add the class feature to the affixes, and all the words will automatically come from the morphological parser with the class number marked.  Any cases where adjectives do not have an affix which marks the class will require marking of the class feature on the particular lexical item in the root dictionary.
<br><br>If your language also has person agreement, in the lexicon add the person features <span class="feature">first</span> (with <span class="feature">exclusive</span> or <span class="feature">inclusive</span> added after a space if distinguished in your language), <span class="feature">second</span> or <span class="feature">third</span> to any adjectives that can only go with that type of noun or pronoun. If the person agreement features are specified by affixes, mark the affixes with the appropriate features instead.  (If your language does not have this type of agreement, simply do not add any features.)
<br><br>If your language also has number agreement: in the lexicon, mark the adjectives that can only go with singular nouns with the feature <span class="feature">singular</span>.  Mark the those that can only go with plural nouns with the feature <span class="feature">plural</span>.  Do not add any feature for number agreement to ones which can go with either singular or plural nouns.  Note: if your language makes a further distinction for dual marking, add the feature <span class="feature">dual</span> to the appropriate entries. If the number agreement features are specified by affixes, mark the affixes with the appropriate features instead.  (If your language does not have this type of agreement, simply do not add any features.)
<br><br>If applicable, add the gender features <span class="feature">masculine</span>, <span class="feature">feminine</span>, <span class="feature">neuter</span> to any adjectives that can only go with that type of noun.
