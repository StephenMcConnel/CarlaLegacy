<h2>Pre/Post-Positional Phrases - Complements</h2>
<div class="introduction">
<p>Prepositions or postpositions normally take a nominal phrase for their complements, as in <span class="example">to Bill's house</span> and <span class="example">under the giant Sycamore tree</span>.  In addition, some pre/post-positions can stand alone, such as in the sentences <span class="example">Come right in</span>, or <span class="example">Turn the light on/off</span>.</p>

<p>[Note: the starter kit grammar rules assume that objects of pre/post-positions have accusative case.  Ergative or absolutive case will not be ruled out, but if you need to require only one of them as objects of pre/post-positions, see the <A href="advanced.doc">Advanced Help</a> file.  If you need other cases than accusative as complements, see the <A href="advanced.doc">Advanced Help</a> file.]</p>
