<ol style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.025in">
<li id=NPArtAgrAnimacyInstruction>To handle animacy:
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.025in">
<li>mark the articles and demonstratives that can only go with animate nouns with the feature <span class="feature">animate</span>.

<li>Mark the articles and demonstratives that can only go with inanimate nouns with the feature <span class="feature">-animate</span>.

<li>Do not add any animacy agreement feature to those which can go with either animate or inanimate nouns.</li>
</ul>
We will assume that all (common) nouns are inanimate by default. Therefore, only the animate nouns need to be marked.  In the lexicon, add the feature <span class="feature">animate</span> to any animate nouns, such as <span class="example">person</span>, <span class="example">people</span>, <span class="example">crowd</span>, <span class="example">animal</span>, and names of types of animals which are not proper names.  (Proper names will be dealt with in section <span class="section">6&nbsp;&nbsp;Pronouns and Proper Names</span> and will be
  assumed to be animate by default.)

<li id=NPArtAgrClassInstruction>To handle class:
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.025in">
<li>mark the articles and demonstratives that can only go with a particular class with the feature <span class="feature">class_##</span>, where ## is replaced by a number
	between 1 and 99.

<li>It may be the case that the same affixes that mark
	the class number on articles and demonstratives (and possibly adjectives
	too) also mark the class number on nouns. If this is the case in your
	language, simply add the class feature to the affixes, and all the words
	will automatically come from the morphological parser with the class number
	marked.

<li>Any cases where articles, demonstratives, or nouns do not have an affix which marks the class will require marking of the class feature on the particular lexical item in the root dictionary.</li>
</ul>
<li id=NPArtAgrNumberInstruction><span id="NPArtAgrNumberOptionalInstruction">If your language also has number agreement: i</span><span id="NPArtAgrNumberObligatoryInstruction">I</span>n the lexicon,
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.025in">
<li>mark the articles and demonstratives that can only go with singular nouns with the feature <span class="feature">singular</span>.

<li>Mark the articles and demonstratives that can only go with plural nouns with the feature <span class="feature">plural</span>.

<li>Do not add any feature for number agreement to ones like <span class="example">the</span> in English which can
	go with either singular or plural nouns.

<li>If your language makes a further distinction for dual marking, add the feature <span class="feature">dual</span> to the appropriate articles and demonstratives.</li>
</ul>
We will assume that all nouns are singular by default.  Therefore, only the plural nouns need to be marked.  In the lexicon,
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.025in">
<li>add the feature <span class="feature">plural</span> to any affixes which can be added to a
	noun to make it plural.

<li>Also, add the feature <span class="feature">plural</span> to any nouns which are inherently plural (such as <span class="example">scissors</span> or <span class="example">pants</span> in English), or exceptionally
	don't take an affix.

<li>Any nouns which do not make a distinction between singular and plural forms, such as <span class="example">deer</span> in English, need to be have two entries in the lexicon, one marked with the feature <span class="feature">plural</span> and the other for singular (which can be explicitly marked or allowed to use the default).  The parser will choose the correct form based on the context.</li>
</ul>
<li id=NPArtAgrPersonInstruction><span id="NPArtAgrPersonOptionalInstruction">If your language also has person agreement, i</span><span id="NPArtAgrPersonObligatoryInstruction">I</span>n the lexicon,
<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.025in">
<li>add the person features <span class="feature">first</span> (with <span class="feature">exclusive</span> or <span class="feature">inclusive</span> added after a space if distinguished in your language), <span class="feature">second</span> or <span class="feature">third</span> to any articles or
	demonstratives that can only go with that type of noun or pronoun.

<li>(If you do not have this type of agreement, simply do not add any features.)</li>
</ul>
All nouns are also assumed to be third person by default; only pronouns have other person features.  These will be dealt with in section <span class="section">6&nbsp;Pronouns and Proper Names</span>.

<li id=NPArtAgrGenderInstruction>If applicable, add the gender features <span class="feature">masculine</span>, <span class="feature">feminine</span>, <span class="feature">neuter</span> to any articles or demonstratives that can only go with that type of noun or pronoun.</li>
