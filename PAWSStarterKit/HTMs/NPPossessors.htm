<h2>Nominal Phrases - Possessors</h2>
<div class="introduction">
<p>The next type of modifier to consider is possessors.  Possession can normally be expressed by a possessive pronoun (to be addressed in section <span class="section">6&nbsp;Pronouns and Proper Names</span>) or by a full nominal phrase.  Many languages also add some kind of marking, such as the <span class="example">'s</span> in English, as an indication of possession.  These markings are either affixes (or clitics) on the head noun or phrase-level clitics which attach to one end of the whole phrase.  The English marking is this second type, because alongside phrases where the <span class="example">'s</span> appears to attach to the head noun, as in <span class="example">the boy's mother</span>, there are phrases which clearly show that the clitic attaches to the end of the whole nominal phrase, such as <span class="example">the boy that I just talked to's mother</span> or <span class="example">the girl in green's wonderful speech</span>.</p>
</div><br><div class="instruction">
<p>Think about how possession is expressed in your language.  We won't be able to handle pre/post-positional phrases until section <span class="section">7&nbsp;Pre/Post-positional Phrases</span> and relative clauses within nominal phrases until section <span class="section">15&nbsp;Fully Modified Nominal Phrases</span>, but examples such as the English ones above will clarify for you what type of possessive marking you have.<br><br>
Note also that possessors can be embedded in one another, as in <span class="example">the boy's sister's dog</span>.  Include such an example in your test data.</p>

<p>[Note that if your language has a syntactic distinction between alienably and inalienably possessed nouns, this will have to be dealt with later, using the <A href="AdvancedHelp.doc#Possessed">Advanced Help</A> file.]</p>
