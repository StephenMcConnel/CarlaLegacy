SENTRANS.TXT Release notes for SENTRANS Sentence Transfer Program

SENTRANS disambiguates and rearranges morphemes, words, and
phrases in files output by AMPLE. SENTRANS is documented in the
file SENTRANS.DOC.

Change History:

2.0.4  Oct 2000 Fixed a bug: the SenTrans32.exe version would crash
if there was no log file.

2.0.3  Sep 2000 Increase memory processing limit of 64000 to 640000.

2.0.2  Jul 2000 Create a DJGPP version.

2.0.1  Jun 2000 Remember morpheme category information in the \cat field.

2.0.0  Jun 2000 Create a DLL version.

1.2zh  Feb 2000 Fixed a bug: it would crash if a failure was missing
a \cat field.

1.2zg  Nov 1999 Fixed a bug: it did not always count input
ambiguities correctly

1.2zf  Jun 1999 Fixed a bug: would not allow ampersands within morphnames.

1.2ze  Apr 1999 Fixed a bug: a reject rule with a repeated affix would
incorrectly disambiguate a single occurrence of that affix.

1.2zd Nov 1998 Fixed a bug: an ending punctuation symbol
in a replacement without following environment would crash
Win32 version.

1.2zc Nov 1998 Fixed a bug (probably introduced in v. 1.2a):
when a begin punctuation symbol is also used as an end
punctuation symbol, it erroneously treated the begin
occurrence as if it were an end occurrence.

1.2zb Oct 1998 Insist that all optional replacement elements
have identical match elements as originally intended.
(I.e. if there is an optional replacement with no
corresponding match, give an error message.)

1.2za Oct 1998 Fix bug which caused Win32 version to crash
on non-ANA input.

1.2z Sep 1998 Send errlogfile error messages to logfile,
too, if the logfile is redirected to a file.  Refine 1.2y so
that capitalization of a deleted root within a "Cat=A > -B"
kind of rule does not put A's capitalization on a following
word.

1.2y Sep 1998 Refine 1.2x so that it applies only to
replacements and not to deletions or initial insertions.

1.2x Sep 1998 Fix a bug which failed to maintain
capitalization of the initial matching word in a replacement
when it was not sentence initial

1.2w Aug 1998 Fixed a bug that crashed Win32 version when a category
was missing.  Added compile time display.

1.2v Apr 97 Don't treat ] or } as close of class name unless [ or
{ was present to open the class name. This fixed problems in
languages that use those characters in their orthography.

1.2u Apr 97 Fix bug in 1.2t of AFF- > AFF- outputting garbage.
Note that PREF- > -SUFF replaces in place, so suffix attaches to
previous word. Similarly, SUFF- > PREF- puts prefix on following
word. To change on the same word, include the word category:
PREF- N > N -SUFF

1.2t Apr 97 Fix bug from 1.2a of seeing \f \\v as an element to
match ~Conj in / # ~Conj _.

1.2s Apr 97 Make split and join work. Split is changing an affix
to a word. Join is changing a word to an affix.

1.2r Apr 97 Make affix substitution work. One or more affixs
without a root are now acceptable as a match. Replacement affixes
are put in where the matched affix was. If there are multiple
matched suffixes, the replacement goes where the last suffix was.
If there are multiple mathed prefixes, the replacement goes where
the first prefix was.

1.2q Apr 97 Don't keep affixes if root completely deleted.

1.2p Apr 97 Allow / and _ in morphnames if not followed by space.
Also allow parends in morphnames if not preceded by space.

1.2n Apr 97 Fix bug of zero at eof with no nl inserting zero.

1.2m Apr 97 Fix bug of not correctly distinguishing multiples of
same affix class.

1.2k Apr 97 Fix bug of problems when a rule has all elements optional.

1.2h Dec 95 Processing of properties (\mp morpheme and allomorph \ap).
Also, we handle properties in the rule environments but not in the match and
replace sections of the rules.
Also, recognize \tagchar <ch> to set the tag character, which defaults to '^'

1.2h Dec 95 Applying property rules in environments.

1.2f Nov 95 Fixed a bug so the number of occurrences of \rulesoff
and \ruleson in a rule file are reported correctly.

1.2e Nov 95 Fixed a bug that prevented a morpheme class suffix in
a rule from being recognized if it was inside square brackets.
For example, -[mcl] is now recognized  correctly.

1.2d Nov 95 Fixed a bug that could cause SENTRANS to crash when
it ran out memory. It now exits gracefully with an out of memory
message.

1.2c Nov 95 Fixed a bug from version 1.2a that allowed words
inserted at the beginning of a sentence to be inserted in front
of initial punctuation, markers, etc.  It also fixed a problem
that caused the trace to output initial punctuation, markers,
etc. as the first word of the sentence being processed instead of
the first real word.

1.2b Jun 95 Fixed a new capitalization bug that appeared in 1.2a.

1.2a Jun 95 Added code to improve punctuation handling. It is now
possible to insert and delete punctuation marks. This fixes some
problems.  But it may cause some existing rules to delete
punctuation marks where they didn't before. For example,
previously the rule: x ! > y would change x to y before an
exclamation point.  Now it also deletes the exclamation point, so
it should now be written: x > y / _ !

A bug was fixed that caused: x ... ! > x ... N=y to insert y one word
before the end of the sentence. It is now inserted at the end of the
sentence. However, the above rule must now include the exclamation
point in the replacement as well: x ... ! > x ... N=y !
But this rule would be better expressed as: ! > N=y ! / x ... _

A bug was fixed that caused: x ... # and # ... x to fail. Code was
also added to make ... x and x ... work. Initial ellipses now reach
to the beginning of the sentence and final ellipses reach to the end
of the sentence.

1.2a Jun 95 Also added code to output a \u field for inserted
words. It is filled in with the same form as the inserted word.

1.2a Jun 95 Also added code to limit the length of sentences to
100 words. This allows processing of word lists. However, it
means that sentence boundaries will appear at arbitrary places in
the word list, which may cause rules to apply in unexpected ways.

1.2 May 95 Added code to require matching parens without
whitespace between for optional items in rules and removed parens
from default punctuation list

1.1y Oct 94 fixed a bug in which deleting a word lost the
punctuation of the preceding word.

1.1w Oct 94 fixed a bug in which deleting a word lost the format
of the following word.

1.1v Oct 94 fixed a bug in which deleting a word lost the
capitalization of the following word.

1.1u Oct 94 fixed a bug in which the output from an analysis with
more than about 200 ambiguities would be corrupted.  1.1u also
fixed a new bug in 1.1t of losing some percent signs in trace
output.

1.1t Aug 94 has enhancements that allow it to be compiled as a
Windows function and a DLL function. It should be functionally
equivalent to 1.1s.

1.1s Jul 94 fixed a bug of a false error message appearing in
certain cases. The message said "Illegal use of >, /, or _ in
rule". When it appeared falsely, it would have no line showing
under it. The error message was added to the program at some time
in 1993, but there is no record of what version was the first to
have the message.  1.1s also passes the \u (underlying form)
field of the analysis file on to output. This field is new in
AMPLE 1.9k.

1.1m Mar 94 fixed a bug of preceding context of intitial #
showing garbage.  1.1m also fixed a bug in 1.1k of not ignoring
erroneous rules.

1.1k Mar 94 fixed some whitespace bugs and truncation of the \n
field.  1.1k also fixed some hang conditions in 1.1e.  1.1k also
fixed a but of not allowing classes within classes.

1.1j Feb 94 adds automatic assignment of category to a
replacement so that there is no need to mention category on
simple lexical substitutions. For example:
   \ru black > white The above rule assigns "white" the same
category as was on "black".

Each inserted replace element without a category is assigned the
category of a deleted match element. If there are not enough
deleted match elements to provide categories for all inserted
replace elements, an error message saying "Inserted root must
have category" is given. For example, the following rule
generates an error message:
	\ru black > coal black

To avoid this error message, any inserted replace element that is
not taking the place of a deleted match element should be given a
category. For example, the following corrects the above rule:
	\ru black > N=coal black

1.1j Feb 94 also correctly associates identical items used
multiple times in the match and replace of a rule with each other
in sequence. For example:
   \ru Noun Noun > Noun -ONE Noun -TWO In the above rule the
first Noun in the replace refers to the first Noun in the match
and the second refers to the second.

1.1j Feb 94 also allows tags to distinguish elements with
otherwise identical names. Tags are written as ^xxx where xxx is
the tag. For example:
   \ru Noun of Noun^2 > Noun^2 -GEN Noun The above rule reverses
the two nouns while converting to a genetive construction.

1.1j Feb 94 also implements repetition of elements with a plus
sign. For example:
	\ru Dem (Adj+) N > (Adj+) Dem N The above rule moves a Dem
element past any number of Adj elements.

1.1j Feb 94 also implements patterns. For example:
   \pat PP  Prep (Dem) (Adj+) N
   \pat NP  (Dem) (Adj+) N (PP)

   \ru NP of NP^2 > NP^2 -GEN NP
The above rule reverses the two noun phrases while converting to
a genetive construction.

A pattern must be defined before it is used. A pattern can
include the name of another pattern. However, a pattern cannot be
made to recursively refer to itself or to another pattern that
refers to it.

1.1j Feb 94 also implements AND of multiple environments using
the symbol &/.  For example:
   \ru black > white / _ ... board &/ ~_ ... bird

The above environment says the rule should apply if the word
"board" is found somewhere to the right, AND the word "bird" is
not found somewhere to the right.

If the environment contains multiple environments OR'ed together
the OR is given higher priority than AND. For example:
	\ru black > white / _ ... board / _ ... smith &/ ~_ ... bird

In the above rule, the first two environments are OR'ed together,
and then the result is AND'ed with the third. This means that the
word "bird" is not allowed with either the word "board" or the
word "smith".

1.1j Feb 94 also implements rule sets, where output of each rule
in the set cannot be reprocessed by other rules in the same set.
Rule sets are delimited with markers as shown below:
   \ruleset
   ...
   ... set of rules that will not feed each other
   ...
   \endruleset

Any number of rule sets can be defined. Rules from different rule
sets can feed each other, but rules from a single ruleset cannot
feed each other.

1.1j Feb 94 also added a marker that causes all following \am and
\rej rules to be treated as \amun and \rejun rules requiring
unanimous environment.
	\unanimous
	...
	... set of rules to be treated as unanimous environment rules
	...
	\nonunanimous

This was done mostly to make it easy to make experiments to see
the effect of unanimous environments on existing rule sets. We do
not plan to support this option in the menu.

1.1e Dec 93 fixed a bug of hang on duplicated root:
	\ru x > x x
The above rule is now rejected as an error.

1.1e Dec 93 also fixed a bug of failing all alternatives on a
negated affix environment. For example:
	\rej x > -Y ~_ The above rule now works correctly.

1.1e Dec 93 also fixed a bug of failing to match some loose
affixes in environments. For example:
	\am x > _ ... -SUFF The environment on the above rule now
correctly finds any word with -SUFF on it.

1.1e Dec 93 also fixed a bug of classes with brackets not working
in rules, and fixes some whitespace bugs.

1.1e Dec 93 also removed a limitation which did not allow a
negated affix after other affixes. For example:
	\am x / _ y -SUFF ~-SUFF2 The above rule used to reject
~-SUFF2 as an error. It now works as expected.

1.1e Dec 93 also removed a limitation which did not allow a
negated affix in the match of a rule.
	\am x ~-SUFF The above rule used to reject ~-SUFF as an
error. It now works as expected. (It matches any x that does not
have a -SUFF anywhere on it.)

1.1e Dec 93 also adds a flag -v for dumping class contents to the
log file.

1.1d Sep 93 cleans up trace display.

1.1c Sep 93 allows 0 as a replacement, as an alternative to an
empty side of the rule.

1.1c Sep 93 also adds statistics on ambiguity flow.

1.1b Aug 93 allows -> instead of > to start the replacement, and
allows ## instead of # to stand for sentence boundary.

1.1a Jun 93 adds new rule forms and fixes certain bugs that
sometimes made it necessary to reboot.  \rulesoff and \ruleson
are added for controlling the set of rules.  \rejun and \amun are
added (by analogy to \rej and \am).  These forms require
unanimous match in the environment in order to act.

Backslash is not allowed as sentence punctuation.  Tracing shows
rule numbers and first words of sentences.  The version number is
announced to the screen.  The bug of /_ not working in
environments is removed.

Classes are allowed to include other classes, and that inclusion
can optionally be stated with square brackets around the included
class name, e.g.:
	\cl tense [past] PRESENT

1.0s Apr 93 was sent out in the CARLA release of Sep 93.

1.0s Apr 93 added numbers after ambiguity monitor dots.

1.0r Apr 93 outputs a warning to the log file when an \ru rule
disambiguates.  1.0r also changed the trace output to show the
rule first and to show the changed word at the front of the line.
This makes the trace easier to read.

1.0q Mar 93 fixed a bug which caused punctuation to not be
correctly matched in environments.

1.0p Mar 93 allows much greater storage space for rules. It also
outputs statistics and the time of the run to the log file.  It
also adds numbers to the monitor display.  1.0p also fixed a bug
which caused input files with no punctuation to run out of memory
space.

1.0n Jan 93 fixed a bug in 1.0m which caused the default comment
character to not be recognized.

1.0m Nov 92 added a -c command line option which changes the
comment character used in the rule file.

1.0k Nov 92 fixed a bug which caused any error in a rule file to
make the program output a zero length file.  1.0k also fixed a
bug which sent error messages to the screen only and not to the
log file.

1.0f Jul 92 accepts \mcl and \ccl as class definitions along with
\cl.  This allows the user interface to feed in the classes built
in it.

1.0e Apr 92 added a reject rule as a way of disambiguating.  It
is like an \am rule, but starts with \rej instead.  It rejects
any ambiguity it matches instead of accepting it.  If a rejection
rule matches every analysis in a word, then it does not reject
any of them.  (It can't reject them all, and it has no reason to
prefer any one of them, so it can't effectively do anything.)

1.0d Mar 92 fixed a bug which caused sentence intial environment
/ # _ to fail to match.

1.0c Jan 92 fixed a bug which caused a "Memory full" message if a
line contained two wedges or a wedge after a slash.

1.0b Jan 92 fixed bugs in the error messages for inserted word
and root.  Also fixed a bug in trace display of compound root
rules.

1.0a Nov 91 was given out for field test in Nov 91.
