SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENTATION ON SENTRANS

Bill Mann

June 12, 1993

Sentrans has recently been modified extensively, resulting in version 1.1a.

The major changes are involved with how environments in rules are allowed
to match.   Rules  (\am, \rej or \ru) have the form

MATCH / LEFT _ RIGHT

The MATCH, LEFT and RIGHT regions each consist of a sequence of one or more
words, possibly with affixes and other complications.

The rule would be used provided that some interpretation of the LEFT
region matches, and some interpretation of RIGHT matches.

This is a problem in that the interpretation that matches may be in error,
some ambiguity that does not represent the actual sentence structure.
Many people have wanted something more reliable.  The addition in this
version is to allow the rule to require unanimous match in the
environment.  This means that with unanimity, EVERY interpretation of LEFT
and RIGHT must match the text with its ambiguities.

To implement this, two additional disambiguation rule types have been added:

\amun  (corresponding to \am):    Accept MATCH if the environment matches
								  unambiguously.

\rejun  (corresponding to \rej):  Reject MATCH if the environment matches
								  unambiguously.

I recommend that as many of your rules as possible be \rejun tests.  They
will not fire unless the environment justifies it, and the basis for the
rejection is visible in the rule, unlike \amun and \am rules, in which you
must imagine the things being removed.

EXPERIMENTING WITH THE RULES

It is good to test the rules, and to be sure that they have the intended
consequences.  One help in doing this is to turn on tracing (the -t
command line flag) and see what the rules are doing.

Another aid, new in version 1.1a, is to turn off all of the rules except
the one(s) that you want to test.  Two new commands, \ruleson and
\rulesoff are provided.  They can be inserted into the rule sequence, and
they apply to all of the rules below them until another occurs, e.g.
given the sequence

\am ..
\rulesoff
\rej ..
\amun ..
\ruleson
\rejun ..
\rejun ..

the first \am and the two \rejun rules would be tried.  Any number of
\ruleson and \rulesoff can be used, and they need not alternate in an
on/off sequence.
