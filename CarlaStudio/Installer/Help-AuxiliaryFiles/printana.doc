			  PRINTANA v. 1.0
		A Tool for Printing Analyses
		   Andy Black, 07-AUG-90

PRINTANA is filter for displaying an analysis file in a readable
format (unlike the raw database output, which is difficult to
read).  PRINTANA's result will be put to the screen unless stan-
dardout is redirected to a file or pipe.

Format markers are included for ease of reference.  The original
word is shown in the left column and all analyses are in the
right column.  Any analytic failures are marked with an asterisk.
If the original word is not included in the analysis file,
the original word is not displayed.

The following sample output is from some Caquinte data
(which resided in the file cqtest.ana).  It was produced by
typing:
	printana cqtest.ana
