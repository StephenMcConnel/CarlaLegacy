PHONRULE.TXT Release Notes for PHONRULE Phonological Rule Program

PHONRULE applies phonological rules to dictionary entries to
generate allomorphs for AMPLE. PHONRULE is documented in the file
PHONRULE.DOC.

Change history:



0.2w Dec 2000 Allow dictionary entries to be as large as
50000 bytes (rather than only 5000).

0.2w Dec 2000 Modifed so it no longer gives a warning message about
CarlaStudio-specific field codes being "undefined".

0.2v Sep 2000 Increased temporary memory work space size from 63000 to
640000.  This should prevent PhonRule from running out of memory when
loading large rule sets.

0.2u Sep 1998 Added compile time display.  Created DJGPP, Win32, and
8086 versions.  Conformed monitoring display to new standard.

0.2t Oct 95 fixes a bug introduced in 0.2o that caused a warning
message to be generated for \id and \dis fields in a rule file.

0.2s Sep 95 removes the noload capability added in 0.2q.  It also
fixes a bug introduced in 0.2r that kept base rules from working.

0.2r May 95 can create an allomorph with a combined environment
from two rules that both apply to a dictionary entry. To be able
to combine environments, the environments of the two rules that
apply must have stuff on opposite sides of the underline.  For
example:

	\pr N x -> y / _ z
	\pr N w -> u / q _

Applied to the following entry:

	\r wax
	\c N

Produces the following output:

	\r wax
	\a uay / q _ z  | This allo demonstrates the new behavior for version 0.2r
	\a uax / q _
	\a way / _ z


0.2q May 95 adds the ability to ignore noload records. The
default noload marker PHONRULE looks for is \no. A different
marker can be specified in the rule file with the \noload marker.

Example:

\noload dontload
in the rule file would keep records containing a \dontload marker
from being processed.

0.2p May 95 fixes a bug that caused a base rule with a +/
environment to insert a morpheme property of + in an entry.

0.2o May 95 adds warning messages for any undefined fields in the
rule file.

0.2n May 95 adds the requirement that categories used in a rule
must be in the \ca field.

0.2m May 95 fixes a bug that resulted in inproper deletion of
classes in a rule. It also fixes a bug that caused \pri and \prf
to work like \pr.

0.2l May 95 fixes a bug which caused fields in the dictionary
commented out with a \co marker to be recognized anyway.
PHONRULE now requires dictionary field markers to be at the
beginning of a line.

0.2k Mar 95 fixes a number of bugs including the handling of
whitespace in allos, monitor digits, word counts, and \ccl.

0.2g Jul 94 fixes a bug which cuased morpheme properties from
base rules to be duplicated if the output dictionary had the same
set of rules run on it again.

0.2f May 93 adds \bri and \brf markers that work like \pri and
\prf.

0.2e Apr 93 fixes a bug in 0.2d which caused allomorphs to be
inserted after the \_no field from Shoebox instead of after the
base when the base was not the key.

0.2d Mar 93 keeps the Shoebox number field, and makes sure to not
insert anything before it.  This makes the file load more quickly
into Shoebox and avoids an internal error bug in Shoebox version
2.

0.2d Mar 93 also fixes a bug which caused base rules to insert an
allo that already existed.

0.2c Mar 93 fixes a bug which caused the program to output an
empty dictionary file if all rules contained errors.

0.2b Mar 93 fixes a bug which caused the program to hang or give
other problems when a rule contained an undefined class.

0.2a Jan 92 removes the need for string classes to be ordered
with the longest first.

0.1w Jul 92 adds pound sign (#) as a word boundary symbol.  For
example the following apply only to one-syllable words:

	\pr #[C]e -> [C]i / _ a
	\pr e[C]# -> i[C] / a _

0.1v May 92 allows base rules (\br) to insert morpheme properties
into entries.  Such properties are placed after the replacement
of the rule, and before any environment.  For example the
following rule:

	\br ar -> 0 a-vowel

Applied to the following entry (Spanish):

	\r hablar
	\c V
	\g speak

Produces the following output (if the base is an allomorph):

	\r hablar
	\a habl
	\mp a-vowel
	\c V
	\g speak

As shown  above,  properties  inserted  by  a  base rule can show
underlying  phonological  characteristics  of  a  word  that  are
visible in the citation form, but are not visible in the root.

0.1u May 92 adds the markers \pri for initial and \prf for final.
These are exactly like \pr except that they force the change to
be applied morpheme initially or finally.  They are mostly for
rules that have no environment.  They may also help for tone
perturbation or vowel harmony rules whose environments might
appear to be on the wrong side of the morpheme.

0.1t Apr 92 also fixes a bug in which the class order warning was
not given if a shorter string was a subset of the end of a longer
one.

0.1t Apr 92 also fixes a bug which caused base rule applications
to be monitored.  They seem different than allomorph generation
rules, so the program now does not monitor them.  The numbers in
the monitor display now reflect the actual number of new
allomorphs added to the dictionary.

0.1t Apr 92 eliminates the Shoebox number field from dictionary
entries.  Since PHONRULE modifies the dictionary file, Shoebox
can't use the old number field anyway.  When the number field was
left in, sometimes old number fields would accumulate in entries.
(The number field is of the form \_no 0001.)

0.1t Apr 92 also adds an ability to cut the ends off base forms
at a specific character.  This is useful when extra information
is put onto citation forms to differentiate them.  For example, a
base form of "bear!Noun" wants the end cut off to make it a
legitimate base.

The marker "\cut" is used to give the cutoff character.  For
example, to cut off everything after exclamation point put the
following into the rule file:

	\cut !

The cutoff character can be any character desired.
