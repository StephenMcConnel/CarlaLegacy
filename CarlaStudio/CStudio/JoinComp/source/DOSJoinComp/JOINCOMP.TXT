JOINCOMP.TXT Release notes for JOINCOMP

JOINCOMP joins compound words in the input text so that AMPLE can
analyze them. JOINCOMP is documented in the file JOINCOMP.DOC.

Change history:

0.2q Dec 2000 Some internal changes not visible to the user.

0.2p Jun 2000 fixed some memory leaks.

0.2o Nov 1999 added -k switch to allow the user to control the comment
character used in the dictionary file.  The default is "|".  Also
fixed a bug that failed to read either the \luwfc or \luwfcs fields of
the input text control file.

0.2n May 1999 fixed bug which would remove all bridge characters from
a file that had been previously passed through JoinComp.  Added -h
switch to allow the user to control the "hold" character which is used
in preserving pre-existing bridge characters.  It defaults to CTRL-Q
(which assumes that no one is using CTRL-Q in their text files).

0.2m Aug 1998 added -b switch to allow the user to control the
"bridge" character used (the default continues to be the underscore
character).  Also added display of every 100 words during monitoring
(-m switch).

0.2l Jun 1998 compiled for Win32 machines.

0.2k Sep 95 increases the maximum input line length and ports to
the DJGPP compiler to make a 386 version.

0.2j Oct 92 includes a 386 version which can handle much larger
dictionaries than the plain version.

0.2h Jul 92 adds command line option -v to give fields to be
searched for joined variant forms.  For example, the following
searches for \w, \aw, and \av:

	joincomp -j w -a aw -v av -d x.dic -i x.txt -o x.out

0.2g Jul 92 fixes a bug in 0.2f of putting an underline in front
of joined words that come immediately after a verse number.

0.2f Jul 92 fixes a bug of failing to join words that had
preceding punctuation marks like quotes or parentheses.

0.2e Jul 92 fixes a bug which caused the -a option to fail.

0.2d Jum 92 adds command line options -j and -a to give the
fields to be searched for joined words and allomorphs.  For
example, the following searches for \w and \aw:

	joincomp -j w -a aw -d x.dic -i x.txt -o x.out

If no  markers are given on the command line, default markers are
\r and \a.

0.2c Jul 91 adds the capability to search for allomorphs.  It
searches for the \a field as well as the root field.  (It assumes
the first marker it finds after the \id is the root field.)
(Version 0.2d changed this to default to \r and \a.)
